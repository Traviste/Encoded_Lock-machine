# Encoded_Lock-machine
- Beginner level project: Basic Lock with 3 quadrature encoders and 3 write enables
- The quadrature encoder is a simulation of an actual padlock
- The ALU will take in 3 inputs and randomly outputs 3 values that is an offset of a result from the LFSR and the original 3 inputs.
-If it functions as intended there will be an output signal from the COMBO_check module at the very end
